Flip Fourth Bit

The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must flip (invert) the 4th bit from the end of the binary representation of N. Then the program must print the revised value of N as the output. Please fill in the blanks with code so that the program runs successfully.
Boundary Condition(s):
Input Format:

The first line contains N.

Output Format:

The first line contains the revised value of N after inverting the 4th bit from the end of the binary representation of N.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input: 25

Output:

17

Explanation:

The binary representation of 25 is 11001.

After flipping the 4th bit from the end, the binary representation becomes 10001. The decimal equivalent of 10001 is 17, which is printed as output

Example Input/Output 2:

Input 15

Output:

7

Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs













#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h> 
int main() 
{
int N;
scanf("%d", &N);
printf("%d", );
return 0; 
}
